# What is Go?

<div class="max-w-[600px]">

Go is a programming language designed at, and supported by Google, that aims to make it easy to 
build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

<div class="flex gap-8">

<div>

It is:

* High-level & garbage collected
* C-like in syntax
* Statically, and structurally typed
* Compiled
* Efficient and performant
* Easy to learn, read, and write

</div>

<div class="grow flex items-center">
<div class="grow">

```go {*}{lines:true}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

</div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Structural typing is a class of type system where type compatibility and equivalence are determined
by the type's actual structure or definition and not by other characteristics such as the name given
to the type.

# Why was it created?

<div class="max-w-[600px]">

The team behind Go saw problems with how software was being developed at Google, and designed the 
language to address issues faced "today".

<div class="flex gap-8">

<div class="basis-3/5">

* Missing or poor concurrency support
* Complexity (of the language, tooling, and ecosystem)
* Lack of scalability
* "Insane" build times

</div>

<div class="basis-2/5">

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!--
Lack of scalability here refers to the ability to write and maintain large codebases, scaling up to
large teams, and large systems.

The story goes that Go was designed while waiting for other programs to compile.

Go is designed to be a clean, small, compiled language with modern features, aiming to tackle
improving productivity in an era of multicore processors, networked systems, and large codebases.

Go was initially built in 2007 and subsequently released to the public in 2009.

Some of this is taken from a presentation that one of the creators of Go gave.

No need to preemptively create interfaces.
Define interfaces where a type would be used, not where the type is defined.

No classes. No inheritance (composition). No explicit implementing interfaces.
