# vue3-kawaii

Vue-kawaii is a collection of vue components that render cute characters. It is a vue port for react-kawaii.
The original repo is for vue2 and hasn't been updated. Here I used Claude 3.5 and updated the code to work with
Vue 3. I might someday host the full package on npm, but for now, I'm just using the components in this project.
